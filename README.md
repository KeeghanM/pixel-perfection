# PixelPerfection

PixelPerfection is a unique tool for frontend developers to improve their HTML and CSS skills. PixelPerfection aims to help you test your ability to spot design inconsistencies and correct them in existing code.

## How It Works

1. **Choose Your Challenge:** You pick a challenge that tests different aspects of your HTML and CSS knowledge. Each challenge presents you with two designs, one perfect and one with subtle mistakes.

2. **Spot the Differences:** Using your keen eye for detail, you identify inconsistencies between the two designs.

3. **Correct the Code:** You're provided with the existing code for the incorrect design. Your job is to dive into the HTML and CSS and fix the issues. Your changes update the design in real-time, so you can see the effect of your code adjustments.

4. **Achieve PixelPerfection:** Keep refining until you can't tell the difference between the two designs. Congratulations, you've achieved PixelPerfection!

5. **Level Up:** Completing challenges earns you experience points (XP). The faster and more accurately you solve them, the more XP you earn. Track your progress, climb the leaderboard, and become a PixelPerfection champion!
